# Rick and Morty interview coding task

## Task
Choose a timeframe to complete the task, e.g. 2 hours. Build an app to the best of your ability in the allotted time that implements a feed of images from the following endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/

Documentation: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters

Requirements:
- Display all of the character images from 1 page of results
- No crashes or ANRs
- Use an app architecture of choice: MVP, MVVM, etc

Ideas for optional, bonus features:
- Infinite scrolling / pagination
- Displaying more information of each character
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Offline storage

## My implementation
Everything in the first commit was done in 2 hours. Later commits are just the remaining, listed optional features added with no time constraints.

*Note, architecture decisions were made with time constraint in mind -- a real app with no time constraint would be considerably "cleaner" e.g. only interfaces visible between layers.*
