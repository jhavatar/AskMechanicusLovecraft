![Mechanicus Lovecraft](resources/mechanicus_lovecraft_001.webp?raw=true "Mechanicus Lovecraft")

Project for playing around with:
- OpenAI API 
- chat-app architecture and UI

## Before you build
- Add your OpenAI API key and organization string to `./local.properties` in project root (file not present in the repo):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="myKey"
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION="myOrg"
```
